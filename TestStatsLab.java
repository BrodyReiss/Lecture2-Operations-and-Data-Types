/*
 Create a program that takes 5 test grades (on a scale from 0 - 100) ... sorry no Standards Based Grading
 
The program should 
 - compute the average of the 5 test scores.  
 - compute the variance 
 - comptue the standard deviation of the scores 
 
 If we have the avg, then the variance is:  [(testScore1 - avg) ^ 2  + (testScore2 - avg) ^ 2 + ... ] / number of tests
 The standard deviation is the square root of that value.  
 
 To calculate the square root you can use:  Math.sqrt(value)
